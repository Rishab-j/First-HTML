<!-- 
           THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE ON HOW ONE MUST FORMATS HIS WEBSITE
	   TRY TO DIVIDE THE WEBSITE THAT DO DIFFERENT TASK OR REPRESNT DIFFERENT THINGS
	   LIKE A BODY CAN CONTAIN HEADER,MAIN BODY AND FOOTER 
	   THERE ARE MORE SUCH USEFUL TAGS
	   MAKING WEBSITES IN A FORMATTED WAY IS A GOOD PRACTICE

		THIS IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE OUTLOOK OF THE PAGE 
		YOU CAN MAKE SIMILAR PAGE WITHOUT USING SUCH TAGS
		BUT THIS MAKE ARE CODE VERY MUCH READIBLE

		IF YOU USE SUCH TAGS ITS EASY FOR SEARCH ENGINES LIKE GOOGLE TO READ YOUR WEBPAGE
		LIKE IT IS EASY FOR THE SEARCH ENGINE TO LOCATE WHERE THE ARTICLE IS WHERE THE FOOTER IS ETC.
		ALTHOUGH THERE IS MUCH MORE TO IT BUT THIS IS BASIC IDEA

		ONE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THESE HTML TAGS 
		THEY ARE REALLY POWERFUL
